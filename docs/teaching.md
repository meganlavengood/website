As Associate Professor and Area Chair of Music Theory at George Mason, I teach the core undergraduate written theory sequence and seminars for graduate students. I recently worked with other Mason faculty to radically redesign our apporach to undergraduate theory, [which you can read about in the article I published in the journal *Engaging Students*](https://engagingstudentsmusic.org/article/view/7362)_._

## _Open Music Theory_

As part of a team of music theorists, I worked to create [*Open Music Theory *v. 2](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/), which is substantially revised and expanded from its original incarnation. *OMT *is an open-access music theory textbook suitable for the entire theory core curriculum.
