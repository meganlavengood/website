## music theorist

My research primarily deals with popular music, timbre, synthesizers, and recording techniques. My methodology is presented in [my *Music Theory Online *article "The Cultural Significance of Timbre Analysis: A Case Study in 1980s Pop Music, Texture, and Narrative."](https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.20.26.3/mto.20.26.3.lavengood.php) I proceed from a technical analysis of timbre via spectrograms and incorporate cultural and sociological research. I also dabble in music and media (particularly video game music). You can read more about my research on my [Research page](https://meganlavengood.com/research/) and throughout my [blog](https://meganlavengood.com/).
